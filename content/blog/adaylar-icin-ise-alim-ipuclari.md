## THE PROBLEM 3
Shopify has partnered with Wordify on a number of projects, including blog content, Burst.shopfy.com, Hatchful.shopify.com, and numerous landing page projects.

In the lead-up to the launch of Hatchful, Shopify’s free logo maker, the eCommerce giant needed Wordify’s help with their extensive landing page project. They needed dozens of landing pages that were both SEO-friendly and optimized for incoming ad traffic.

## WORDIFY’S SOLUTION
Due to the size of the project, Shopify organized a meticulous spreadsheet to act as a hub for all landing pages.

For each landing page, Shopify’s marketing team provided the keywords, and Wordify’s team produced the bespoke content. Wordify was also entrusted with keeping all the content unique, engaging, and at the desired length.

## THE RESULT
The goal of the Hatchful project was to use engaging, optimized content to raise awareness and encourage sign-ups for Shopify’s newest app. By working with Wordify, Shopify was able to generate a large amount of web traffic for their landing page and increase the number of users for the app.

“I would recommend Wordify to any team looking to develop an effective content strategy or to create engaging content.” — Evan F - Marketing Content Specialist at Shopify.
